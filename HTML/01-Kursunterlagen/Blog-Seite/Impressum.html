    <h1>Hello! My name is Elif Berra, and I’m both a student and an apprentice. In my free time, I love reading. <br>
        Some of my favorite authors include George Orwell, Franz Kafka, Stefan Zweig, and Friedrich Dürrenmatt. On the other hand, I’m not a fan of Goethe and Schiller—I find them way too overrated.
        <br>
        Aside from reading, I enjoy watching anime.<br>
        So far, I’ve watched Demon Slayer (just the first season, since Netflix only has that one), Tsubasa, The Promised Neverland, Haikyuu, and a few others that I can’t quite recall at the moment.
        <br>
        And now, for my favorite part—my cats!<br>
        I have two incredibly smart, cute, and well-behaved cats. The first is named Alpha, and the second is Aykiz. We named the first one Alpha because, after my family adopted her, I noticed that <br>
        she’s unusually social for a cat. In psychology, the term "Alpha" describes a leader, someone who is confident and good at speaking, which perfectly fits her personality.As for the second one,<br>
        her name is Aykiz, which is Turkish. Translated literally, it means "moon girl." My mother chose the name, though to be honest, I’m not really sure why she picked it! I wanted to give her the name Beta actually.
